Simulation of Real-world Power Grid Operations to Generate Realistic Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs) to Reflect the Balance between Supply and Demand at Each Bus.

- Use Texas 7k Grid with a Rich Set of Generators of Various Types including Renewables
- Run Unit Commitment and Economic Dispatch through Advanced Optimization
- Calculate LMPs to Reflect the Balance of Supply and Demand

We design and develop the software Vatic to efficiently simulate the grid operations and the software could be customized to any grid.
